Understanding Rural Settlements in Rwanda.

In 2008-2009 through an aerial photography mission the government of Rwanda had orthoimages covering the whole country with a spatial resolution of 25 cm and only visual spectral bands (blue, green and red). 

While working on my Bachelor thesis using Arcmap I created 88 5x5 km grids avoiding cities and I digitalized every single house present in those grids to sum up to 172893 points.

In this project I am using those points and perform distance calculation vis a vis different population distribution factors such as roads, rivers, schoolsâ€¦

I will use 3 examples each representing one vector data type:
-	Lakes for polygon
-	Roads for line
-	Hospitals for point

Rasterize the results to visualize the distribution and later displaying the percentage of houses found in a particular distance of range. Which goes with understanding the advantage or risks attached for the proximity.
